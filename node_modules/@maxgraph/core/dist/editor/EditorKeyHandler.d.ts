/**
 * Binds keycodes to action names in an editor.  This aggregates an internal {@link handler} and extends the implementation of {@link KeyHandler.escape} to not only cancel the editing, but also hide the properties dialog and fire an <Editor.escape> event via {@link editor}.  An instance of this class is created by {@link Editor} and stored in {@link Editor.keyHandler}.
 *
 * @Example
 * Bind the delete key to the delete action in an existing editor.
 * ```javascript
 * var keyHandler = new EditorKeyHandler(editor);
 * keyHandler.bindAction(46, 'delete');
 * ```
 *
 * @Codec
 * This class uses the {@link DefaultKeyHandlerCodec} to read configuration data into an existing instance.  See {@link DefaultKeyHandlerCodec} for a description of the configuration format.
 *
 * @Keycodes
 * See {@link KeyHandler}.
 * An {@link InternalEvent.ESCAPE} event is fired via the editor if the escape key is pressed.
