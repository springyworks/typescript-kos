/**
 * @class
 *
 * Singleton that implements a clipboard for graph cells.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * Clipboard.copy(graph);
 * Clipboard.paste(graph2);
 * ```
 *
 * This copies the selection cells from the graph to the clipboard and
 * pastes them into graph2.
 *
 * For fine-grained control of the clipboard data the {@link graph.canExportCell}
 * and {@link graph.canImportCell} functions can be overridden.
 *
 * To restore previous parents for pasted cells, the implementation for
 * {@link copy} and {@link paste} can be changed as follows.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * Clipboard.copy = function(graph, cells)
 * {
 *   cells = cells || graph.getSelectionCells();
 *   var result = graph.getExportableCells(cells);
 *
 *   Clipboard.parents = new Object();
 *
 *   for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++)
 *   {
 *     Clipboard.parents[i] = graph.model.getParent(cells[i]);
 *   }
 *
 *   Clipboard.insertCount = 1;
 *   Clipboard.setCells(graph.cloneCells(result));
 *
 *   return result;
 * };
 *
 * Clipboard.paste = function(graph)
 * {
 *   if (!Clipboard.isEmpty())
 *   {
 *     var cells = graph.getImportableCells(Clipboard.getCells());
 *     var delta = Clipboard.insertCount * Clipboard.STEPSIZE;
 *     var parent = graph.getDefaultParent();
 *
 *     graph.model.beginUpdate();
 *     try
 *     {
 *       for (var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++)
 *       {
 *         var tmp = (Clipboard.parents != null && graph.model.contains(Clipboard.parents[i])) ?
 *              Clipboard.parents[i] : parent;
 *         cells[i] = graph.importCells([cells[i]], delta, delta, tmp)[0];
 *       }
 *     }
 *     finally
 *     {
 *       graph.model.endUpdate();
 *     }
 *
 *     // Increments the counter and selects the inserted cells
 *     Clipboard.insertCount++;
 *     graph.setSelectionCells(cells);
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
