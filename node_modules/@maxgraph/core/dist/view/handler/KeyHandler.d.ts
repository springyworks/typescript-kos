/**
 * Event handler that listens to keystroke events. This is not a singleton,
 * however, it is normally only required once if the target is the document
 * element (default).
 *
 * This handler installs a key event listener in the topmost DOM node and
 * processes all events that originate from descandants of {@link Graph#container}
 * or from the topmost DOM node. The latter means that all unhandled keystrokes
 * are handled by this object regardless of the focused state of the <graph>.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * The following example creates a key handler that listens to the delete key
 * (46) and deletes the selection cells if the graph is enabled.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * let keyHandler = new KeyHandler(graph);
 * keyHandler.bindKey(46, (evt)=>
 * {
 *   if (graph.isEnabled())
 *   {
 *     graph.removeCells();
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Keycodes:
 *
 * See http://tinyurl.com/yp8jgl or http://tinyurl.com/229yqw for a list of
 * keycodes or install a key event listener into the document element and print
 * the key codes of the respective events to the console.
 *
 * To support the Command key and the Control key on the Mac, the following
 * code can be used.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * keyHandler.getFunction = (evt)=>
 * {
 *   if (evt != null)
 *   {
 *     return (mxEvent.isControlDown(evt) || (Client.IS_MAC && evt.metaKey)) ? this.controlKeys[evt.keyCode] : this.normalKeys[evt.keyCode];
 *   }
 *
 *   return null;
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Constructor: KeyHandler
 *
 * Constructs an event handler that executes functions bound to specific
 * keystrokes.
 *
 * @param graph Reference to the associated {@link Graph}.
 * @param target Optional reference to the event target. If null, the document
 * element is used as the event target, that is, the object where the key
 * event listener is installed.
