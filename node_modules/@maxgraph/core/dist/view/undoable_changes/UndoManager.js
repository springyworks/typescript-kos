/**
 * @class UndoManager
 *
 * Implements a command history. When changing the graph model, an
 * {@link mxUndoableChange} object is created at the start of the transaction (when
 * model.beginUpdate is called). All atomic changes are then added to this
 * object until the last model.endUpdate call, at which point the
 * {@link mxUndoableEdit} is dispatched in an event, and added to the history inside
 * {@link UndoManager}. This is done by an event listener in
 * {@link Editor.installUndoHandler}.
 *
 * Each atomic change of the model is represented by an object (eg.
 * {@link mxRootChange}, {@link mxChildChange}, {@link mxTerminalChange} etc) which contains the
 * complete undo information. The {@link UndoManager} also listens to the
 * {@link mxGraphView} and stores it's changes to the current root as insignificant
 * undoable changes, so that drilling (step into, step up) is undone.
 *
 * This means when you execute an atomic change on the model, then change the
 * current root on the view and click undo, the change of the root will be
 * undone together with the change of the model so that the display represents
 * the state at which the model was changed. However, these changes are not
 * transmitted for sharing as they do not represent a state change.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * When adding an undo manager to a graph, make sure to add it
 * to the model and the view as well to maintain a consistent
 * display across multiple undo/redo steps.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var undoManager = new UndoManager();
 * var listener(sender, evt)
 * {
 *   undoManager.undoableEditHappened(evt.getProperty('edit'));
 * };
 * graph.getDataModel().addListener(mxEvent.UNDO, listener);
 * graph.getView().addListener(mxEvent.UNDO, listener);
 * ```
 *
 * The code creates a function that informs the undoManager
 * of an undoable edit and binds it to the undo event of
 * {@link mxGraphModel} and {@link mxGraphView} using
 * {@link EventSource.addListener}.
 *
 * ### Event: mxEvent.CLEAR
 *
 * Fires after {@link clear} was invoked. This event has no properties.
 *
 * ### Event: mxEvent.UNDO
 *
 * Fires afer a significant edit was undone in {@link undo}. The `edit`
 * property contains the {@link mxUndoableEdit} that was undone.
 *
 * ### Event: mxEvent.REDO
 *
 * Fires afer a significant edit was redone in {@link redo}. The `edit`
 * property contains the {@link mxUndoableEdit} that was redone.
 *
 * ### Event: mxEvent.ADD
 *
 * Fires after an undoable edit was added to the history. The `edit`
 * property contains the {@link mxUndoableEdit} that was added.
